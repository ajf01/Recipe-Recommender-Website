# Personalized Plates

### Introduction
With our hectic and unpredictable daily schedules, it can be easy to rely on convenient and unhealthy foods that detriment our health. Or oftentimes, indecisiveness in meal preparation can lead to monotonous and unenjoyable meals. The primary goal of our website is to provide you with recipes that are inspired by your favorite meals, and hopefully we can even suggest some new ones that you would like.
